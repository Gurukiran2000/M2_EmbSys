    Depending on the airbag system and  number of airbags being installed, the crash sensors are installed either directly in the control unit or as a satellite in vehicle front end or at the side of vehicle.


 * Safing safety sensor

     It prevents the deployment of airbags unintentionally.


 * Airbag

     Airbag is made up of a highly durable polyamide fabric that resists aging.
     It has  low coefficient of friction to ensure that it unfolds easily and makes soft contact with the skin. 
     The airbag is dusted with talcum powder to protect it and stop it from sticking. 
     When the airbag is deployed, this powder is seen as a white cloud. 
     It has retaining bands on the inside which maintain the shape of the airbag when it is being inflated.
     It is provided with outflow openings on the rear which allow the gas to escape.
    

 * Volute Spring

    This establishes the connection between the rigid steering column and  moving steering wheel. 

 * Airbag cables

    The airbag connectors are bright yellow in colour.
    It consists of a  jumper which prevents the airbag from deploying  unintentionally if work is being carried out on the airbag system.
