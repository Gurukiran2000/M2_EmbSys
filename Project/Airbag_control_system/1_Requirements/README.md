## Requirements
  * HRL1
    To detect sudden decelerations and send electrical signals to activate an initiator.
    * LLR1
       This detection is done using certain sensors called Crash Sensors.
    * LLR2  
       Input port or pin of the controller can be used to do this. 


  * HLR2
    To send electric signal inorder to take necessary action that is open the airbags.
    * LLR3
       This signal is sent and controlled using certain controller.   
    * LLR4
       Outport port or pin can be used to do this task  
       
  * HLR3
    To determine the severity of the deceleration that is being caused.
    * LLR5
        This is achieved based on the number of sensors that send  high.
    * LLR6
        Higher the number of sensors sending high signal more severe is the deceleration.
