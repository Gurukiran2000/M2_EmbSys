## Requirements
  * HRL1
    To detect sudden decelerations and send electrical signals to activate an initiator.
    * LLR1
       This detection is done using certain sensors called Crash Sensors.
    * LLR2  
       Input port or pin of the controller can be used to do this. 


  * HLR2
    To send electric signal inorder to take necessary action that is open the airbags.
    * LLR3
       This signal is sent and controlled using certain controller.   
    * LLR4
       Outport port or pin can be used to do this task  
       
  * HLR3
    To determine the severity of the deceleration that is being caused.
    * LLR5
        This is achieved based on the number of sensors that send  high.
    * LLR6
        Higher the number of sensors sending high signal more severe is the deceleration.    
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
##SWOT ANALYSIS

* Strength
   * Airbags are designed to automatically inflate in the event of a sudden deceleration or impact force that would indicate a collision.
   * They decrease the amount of force impacting a person's head by limiting the distance it can fling forward.
   * The priority of this event is very high since in is involving safety feature.
   
   
 * Weakness 
   * Microcontroller must provide preference to this event irrespective of the other event since it has higher priority.
   * Any failure of the controller or certain sensors might lead to catastrophe.
   * Must be designed and implemented with atmost expertise.

 * Oppurtunities
   * Most of the cars implement this feature inorder to ensure the safety of the passengers.
   * It is of greater importance hence uses good quality sensors and cables inorder to ensure there is no failure.

 * Threats
   * Failure of quality coding might lead to certain danger
   * Validation of the conditions and circuimstances must be done inorder to ensure proper functioning.
   * Various components that are used including the sensors must function properly or else it may lead to danger.




##5W's 1H
* What
  * Implementation of airbag conttrol system is to be done.

* Why
  * Being one of the most important embedded system in automotive domain it has to be done inorder to ensure safety.

* Where
  * This feature is mostly implemented in cars

* When
  * During implementation of all the subsystems that are present in automobile.

* How
  * Making use of the best controller and quality coding
  * Circuit connections also play a vital role.
