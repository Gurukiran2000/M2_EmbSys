## Components Required
*  Water inlet control valve
  *  It is present near the water inlet point of the washing machine.
   When we load the clothes in washing machine, this valve gets opened automatically and it closes automatically depending on the total quantity of the water required. 
   It is actually the solenoid valve.


*    Water pump
  * The water pump circulates water through the washing machine. It works in two directions
    re-circulating the water during wash cycle and draining the water during the spin cycle.


* Rotating disc
  * The agitator is located inside the tub of the washing machine. It is the important part of the washing machine that actually  performs the cleaning operation of the clothes  



* Motor 
  *  The motor is coupled to the agitator or the disc and produces rotation.
     These are multispeed motors, whose speed can be changed as per the requirement    


* Timer
  *  The timer helps setting the wash time for the clothes manually. In the automatic mode the time 
     is set automatically depending upon the number of clothes inside the washing machine and the type of wash cycle being performed     


* Printed Circuit Board
   * The PCB comprises the various electronic components and circuits which are programmed to perform in unique ways depending
      on  the load conditions


* Drain pipe
   *  The drain pipe enables removing the dirty water from the washing that has been used for the washing purpose.
